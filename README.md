ARCADE! It was such a fun experience! 
i had so many new friends, new things comin up,
events, scary reviews sessions ðŸ˜…
but all of that leading to happiness n joy! 
it was fun n it was refreshing! 
it felt like an open sky! with endless possibilities,
at first in this drawing i wanted to represent that
by showing that shes free falling in the sky
but then i ended up turning that jnto the background; P,
in any case, hope you like the artwork!
artwork in repository, this is the last 
submission im gona make to arcade,
so i wanted it to resemble my interpretation 
of arcade, while it couldve been better 
if some great artist drew it or smt,
im still learning, n ive come this far,
orc also thx to arcade n other places ive learnt from
but growth n gain in knowledge awaits us!
AHEM, sorry for such a lkng boring read me
btw, if youve seen my scraps, i usually dont 
type a lot, but since this is the last submission 
ig i just went all out! 
hope you like the art anyway hehe
OH AND, i couldnt decide on which color 
suits the background best so i tried to play around w them, by editing the layer's properties after i drew the background, if you reqd this, please do tell me in the dms or thread which one was your fav, itll also help me learn color schemes ; P, thx
